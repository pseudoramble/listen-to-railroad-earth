Listen to Railroad Earth
=====================================

A small website for listening to Railroad Earth shows. The shows are pulled from Archive.org. This is a small project to make a different UI for it.

This is definitely inspired by ListenToTheDead.com (now found at [http://relisten.net/grateful-dead/](http://relisten.net/grateful-dead/)).

Definite Goals:
-----------------

* Update show listing frequently.
* Allow user to browse in year/show/setlist fashion.
* Make the site responsive.

Future Goals:
-----------------

* Allow for custom searching of shows (more query-like, or perhaps by certain parameters)
* Record stats about usage of the site
* Collect donations for running the server & donating to Archive.org
